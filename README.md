# CS333 Project Spring 2021

This project is focused on the implementation of a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems. The implementation code can be found under the `App` folder, while the final report is available under the `LaTeX` folder.

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to implement a digital signature and public-key cryptosystem using the RSA algorithm. The project includes the following tasks:

* Generating prime numbers
* Calculating the private and public keys
* Signing a message with a private key
* Verifying a signature with a public key

The implementation of the RSA algorithm is done using Python. The `App` folder contains the Python code for the project.

In addition, a final report was created for this project, which is available in the `LaTeX` folder. The report includes a detailed description of the project, including the problem definition, methodology, results, and conclusion.

## Usage
To run the project, navigate to the `App` folder and run the `app.ipynb` file. The program will ask you to enter a message to sign and verify. The program will generate the keys, sign the message, and verify the signature.

```bash
jupyter app.ipynb
```

## Conclusion
This project allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the RSA algorithm, digital signatures, and public-key cryptosystems. The implementation of the algorithm allowed us to see the theory in action and how the various components of the algorithm work together. The final report also helped us to communicate our findings and results in a clear and concise manner.
